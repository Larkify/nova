### Nova is a Discord Bot, which is based around Technology amongst other features.

Nova is a **public** bot available for anyone who wants it in their Discord Server. You can find more information about the bot on it's <a href="https://docs.larkx.xyz/" target="_blank">Documentation Website</a>. The main website regarding all other information can be found <a href="https://larkx.xyz/nova.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Inviting Nova 
If you would like to add the bot, simply head to my <a href="https://larkx.xyz/nova.html" target="_blank">website</a>. All information is contained there, if you think something is missing then please contact me on Discord via `@larkx#0001`. Also, if you are feeling nice then you could perhaps have a look in my <a href="https://larkx.xyz/discord.html" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>!

## Documentation
Need Help? I've got you covered. I've conveniently created a documentation webpage which can be found <a href="https://docs.larkx.xyz/" target="_blank">here</a>. This contains all sorts of information from getting started to the most complicated features and modules of Nova. If you think something is missing, please direct message me on Discord and I can get it all sorted out. As well, if you think that some information listed is perhaps outdated then notify me so I can go and make my changes.

## Why Nova?
The reason you'd pick Nova over a different bot or method is because my bot was designed and based around technology, meaning that there aren't unnecessary moderation, levels or other modules that don't have anything to do with computing. Nova was designed to keep it simple and easy, but carry out the task just the way you want it. To invite Nova, <a href="https://larkx.xyz/invite.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.
